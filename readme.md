# Group Work Notice
This project was developed as part of a group assignment at the Technical University of WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt (THWS). Due to lost contact with some contributors, their involvement cannot be verified or credited further. The code and functionality represent the state of the exercise as completed by the team.

##Starting
Before starting, remember that you may need to replace the `python` command with `py` or `python3` depending on your operating sytem or installed python version

## Configuring your virtual environment

* Install pip by running `python -m ensurepip --upgrade` in your terminal
* Open the terminal in the project folder and type `python -m venv venv`
* Activate the virtual environment by typing `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` on Windows and `source venv/bin/activate` on Linux
* Install Django by running `python -m pip install Django`

## Setting up your own page

* To start your server, activate your virtual environment and type `python manage.py runserver`
* You can now access the page by going to ["http://127.0.0.1:8000"](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
* If you want to change the port or ip, type `python manage.py runserver your_ip:your_port`, however you will need to 
register this url under `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in the `settings.py` and replace the url in the `index.js`
