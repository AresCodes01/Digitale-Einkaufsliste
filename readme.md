## Configuring your virtual environment

* Install pip by running `python -m ensurepip --upgrade` in your terminal  
* Open the terminal in the project folder and type `python -m venv venv`  
* Activate the virtual environment by typing `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` on Windows or `source venv/bin/activate` on Linux/macOS  
* Install Django by running `python -m pip install Django`

## Setting up your own page

* To start your server, activate your virtual environment and type:  
  `python manage.py runserver`

* You can now access the page by opening:  
  [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

* If you want to change the port or IP, run:  
  `python manage.py runserver your_ip:your_port`

  However, you will need to register this URL under `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py` and update the URL in `index.js` accordingly.
